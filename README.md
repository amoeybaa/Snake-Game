# Snake Game in C

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game written in C. The game runs in the command-line interface and allows the player to control the snake using `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys.

The objective is to collect as many fruits as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's own tail.

You can exit the program by pressing `X`.

The folder also includes a variant of the game with pass-through walls, allowing the snake to reappear on the opposite side when it hits a wall.

Compile and run as usual.

**NOTE:** The program uses `conio.h` and `windows.h`, so it is designed for Windows environments.
